P036 [Start Source] Related Parameter(s): 012, PO37
Stop drive before changing this parameter.
Sets the control scheme used to start the drive.

Refer to Start and Speed Reference Control on page 1-23 for details about how other drive settings

can override the setting of this parameter.

Important: For all settings except option 3, the drive must receive a leading edge from the start input
for the drive to start after a stop input, loss of power or fault condition.

Options 0 “Keypad” (Default) e Integral keypad controls drive operation.
e 1/0 Terminal 1 “Stop” = coast to stop.
e When active, the Reverse key is also active unless
disabled by A095 [Reverse Disable].

1 “3-Wire” /O Terminal 1 “Stop” = stop according to the value set in
P037 [Stop Mode].
2 = “2-Wire” /O Terminal 1 “Stop” = coast to stop.
3 “2-W LvI Sens” Drive will restart after a “Stop” command when:
e Stop is removed
and

e Start is held active

ATTENTION: Hazard of injury exists due to unintended operation.
When P036 [Start Source] is set to option 3, and the Run input is
maintained, the Run inputs do not need to be toggled after a Stop input for
the drive to run again. A Stop function is provided only when the Stop input
is active (open).

4 “2-W Hi Speed” Important: There is greater potential voltage on the output
terminals when using this option.

e Outputs are kept in a ready-to-run state. The drive will
respond to a “Start” command within 10 ms.
e 1/0 Terminal 1 “Stop” = coast to stop.

5 “Comm Port” Remote communications. Refer to Appendix C for details.

/O Terminal 1 “Stop” = coast to stop.

Run FWD Input (I/O Terminal 02) or the Run REV Input (I/
O Terminal 03).

P037 [Stop Mode] Related Parameter(s): P036, A080, A081, A082, A105, A160

Active stop mode for all stop sources [e.g. keypad, run forward (I/O Terminal 02), run reverse (I/O
Terminal 03), RS485 port] except as noted below.

Important: I/O Terminal 01 is always a coast to stop input except when P036 [Start Source] is set for
“3-Wire” control. When in three wire control, I/O Terminal 01 is controlled by P037 [Stop Mode].

Hardware Enable Circuitry

By default, I/O Terminal 01 is a coast to stop input. The status of the input is interpreted by drive
software. If the application requires the drive to be disabled without software interpretation, a “dedicat-
ed” hardware enable configuration can be utilized. This is accomplished by removing the ENBL
enable jumper on the control board. In this case, the drive will always coast to a stop regardless of the
settings of P036 [Start Source] and P037 [Stop Mode].

Options 0 ‘Ramp, CF") (Default) Ramp to Stop. “Stop” command clears active fault.

1 ‘Coast, CF") Coast to Stop. “Stop” command clears active fault.
2 “DC Brake, CF!) DC Injection Braking Stop. “Stop” command clears active
fault.

3 “DCBrkAuto,CF%") DC Injection Braking Stop with Auto Shutoff.
e Standard DC Injection Braking for value set in A080 [DC

“Stop” command clears active fault.

“Ramp” Ramp to Stop.

“Coast” Coast to Stop.

Values Default: O0F1

Min/Max: 0001/bAFF

Display: 4 Digits

Parameters A140-A147 are only active if P038 [Speed Reference] is set to 6 “Stp Logic”.

These parameters can be used to create a custom profile of frequency commands. Each “step” can
be based on time, status of a Logic input or a combination of time and the status of a Logic input.

Digits 0-3 for each [Stp Logic x] parameter must be programmed according to the desired profile.

A Logic input is established by setting a digital input, parameters A051 - A054 [Digital Inx Sel], to 23
“Logic In1” and/or 24 “Logic In2”.

Atime interval between steps can be programmed using parameters A150 - A157 [Sip Logic Time xy].
See the table below for related parameters.

The speed for any step is programmed using parameters A070 - A077 [Preset Freq x].

How StepLogic Works

The StepLogic sequence begins with a valid start command. A normal sequence always begins with
A140 [Stp Logic 0].

Digit 0: Logic For Next Step

This digit defines the logic for the next step. When the condition is met the program advances to the
next step. Step 0 follows Step 7. Example: Digit 0 is set 3. When “Logic In2” becomes active, the
program advances to the next step.

Digit 1: Logic to Jump to a Different Step

For all settings other than F, when the condition is met, the program overrides Digit 0 and jumps to the
step defined by Digit 2.

Digit 2: Different Step to Jump

When the condition for Digit 1 is met, the Digit 2 setting determines the next step or to end the program.

Programming and Parameters 3-41

Digit 3: Step Settings

This digit defines what accel/decel profile the speed command will follow and the direction of the
command for the current step. In addition, if a relay or opto output (parameters A055, A058 and A061)
is set to 15 “StpLogic Out’, this parameter can control the status of that output.

Any StepLogic parameter can be programmed to control a relay or opto output, but you can not
control different outputs based on the condition of different StepLogic commands.

StepLogic Settings

The logic for each function is determined by the four digits for each StepLogic parameter. The
following is a listing of the available settings for each digit.

Refer to Appendix E for details.

1 “Save MOP Ref” Reference is saved in A069 [Internal Freq].
(Default)

A163 [DB Threshold] Related Parameter(s): P037, A080, A081, A082

Sets the DC bus Voltage Threshold for Dynamic Brake operation. If the DC bus voltage falls below the
value set in this parameter, the Dynamic Brake will not turn on. Lower values will make the Dynamic
Braking function more responsive but may result in nuisance Dynamic Brake activation.

Values Default 100.0%
Min/Max: 0.0/110.0%

value that causes the dynamic braking resistor to dissipate excessive power.
Parameter settings less than 100% should be carefully evaluated to ensure
that the dynamic brake resistor's wattage rating is not exceeded. In general,
values less than 90% are not needed. This parameter’s setting is especially
important if parameter A082 [DB Resistor Sel] is set to 2 “No Protection’.

ATTENTION: Equipment damage may result if this parameter is set a

A164 [Comm Write Mode]

Determines whether parameter changes made over communication port are saved and stored in
Non-Volatile Storage (NVS) or RAM only. If they are stored in RAM, the values will be lost at
power-down.

Options 0 “Save” (Default)

1 “RAM Only’

ATTENTION: Risk of equipment damage exists. If a controller is programmed to
write parameter data to Non-Volatile Storage (NVS) frequently, the NVS will quickly
exceed its life cycle and cause the drive to malfunction. Do not create a program that
frequently uses configurable outputs to write parameter data to NVS unless A164
[Comm Write Mode] is set to option 1.

A165 [Anlg Loss Delay] Related Parameter(s): A122

Sets the length of time after power-up during which the drive will not detect an analog signal loss. The
drive response to an analog signal loss is set in A122 [Analog In Loss].

Values Default: 0.0 Secs
Min/Max: 0.0/20.0 Secs
Display: 0.1 Secs
A166 [Analog In Filter]

Sets level of additional filtering of the analog input signals. A higher number increases filtering and
decreases bandwidth. Each setting doubles the applied filtering (1 = 2x filter, 2 = 4x filter, etc...). No
additional filtering is applied when set to “0”.

Values _ Default: 0
Min/Max: 0/14
Display: 1
A167 [PID Invert Error]

When set to “Inverted”, changes the sign of the PID error. This causes an increase in the drive output
frequency with PID Feedback greater than PID Setpoint, and a decrease in drive output frequency
with PID Feedback less than PID Setpoint.

Options 0 “Not Inverted” (Default)
